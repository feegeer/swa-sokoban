Software Architecture Documentation of Group Sokoban
====================================================

This project is about the development of a distributed Sokoban game that can be played across a network of different clients.

The project's software architecture documentation is loosely based on the arc42 template, with project-specific adaptions made to better suit the completed tasks from the exercise sheets. The included software requirements specification is compliant to the IEEE Std 830-1998.
